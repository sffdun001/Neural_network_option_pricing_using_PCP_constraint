Note that in terms of naming, the files names that include MLP with no SC, HC3 or HC4; refer to the files where no constraint has been applied. SC denoted code relating to the soft constraint, HC3 denotes code relating to $\text{HC}_1$ and HC4 denotes code relating to $\text{HC}_2$. Training and testing of networks for the various data sets (Hutchinson, Black, Heston and Market) are named accordingly.
